Learning Enhanced by Action and Projection

## Introduction

Problems define innovation. Our product is not merely a product, it expands on making education seamless for everyone, and improving the quality of millions of lives. Itâ€™s about using existing resources to create something impactful.

### How?

We are mainly creating two systems:

1. Gesture Controlled Smart-Boards(GeCoS)
2. RFID Attendance system(RiA)

### Documentation

## GeCoS

The first system, GeCoS; aims to solve on of the biggest problems encountered by many teachers: Setting up and controlling the Smart-Boards.

GeCoS can solve this problem by making controlling the Smart-Boards easier.

It uses the MediaPpe library for python to identify gestures from a live feed and then take action accordingly.

## RiA

RiA stands for RFID Attendance System.
It uses Pytest for tests and will be written using TDD(Test Driven Development).
Pytest version 7.1.3 was used, in combination with python 3.11.x
